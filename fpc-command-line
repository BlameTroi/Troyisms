fpc command line options

for release

-O1 -Xs -Sgix -ap -vewnhlb

for development

-glw3 -Ciort -ap -Sgix -vewnhlb

i don't see a way to set booleval on from the command line, the following
preamble is probably needed in all code

{$LONGSTRINGS OFF}
{$BOOLEVAL ON}
type
  integer = int64;


reference

on apple use pipes instead of temp files
-ap

semantics
-Sg  label and goto
-Sh  ansistrings (not always)
-Si  allow inline
-Sx  enable exception keywords


code generation checks
-Ci io check
-Co overflow
-Cr range
-Ct stack

optimizer
-Os for smaller code
-Oa=N  alignment = n
-O1    level 1 optimizations, debuggable
-O2/3  not worth it i think

paths
let default paths from fpc.cfg take care of many things
but for my own units and includes ...
-FEpath output of executables and units
-FUpath output of units (overriding -FE)
-Fupath input units
-Fipath input includes


linking
-gc check for pointers
-gl line info unit for backtrace
-gw3 dwarf

misc
-vewnhlb gets errors, warnings, notes, hints, file name and path, line numbers
