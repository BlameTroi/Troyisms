			       Troyisms
			There's the right way,
			    the wrong way,
			   and the Troy Way
			======================

These are notes, tricks, code snippets, and things others might wish
I didn't do. I don't think in terms of gists, but that's where some
of these might belong. A repository works for me.

If I was still blogging, much of this would be in blog posts. I
stopped blogging because the available infrastructure is all about
getting clicks, generating revenue, engagement, influencing, and
other such things.

I blogged to write. Being read is nice, but the writing is essential
to being.

Regardless, there's nothing important to anyone else here. Likely
nothing too interesting either. I expect some of these things are
'bad ideas'.

Use at your own risk. It's all public domain as far as I'm concerned,
but you can use any code from this either as public domain under the
UNLICENSE or under the terms of the MIT license.
