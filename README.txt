			There's the right way,
			    the wrong way,
			   and the Troy Way
			======================

These are notes, tricks, code snippets, ramblings, screeds, and things
others might wish I didn't do. I also keep some reference copies of
older documents by others. It's easier to find them here than doing
yet another web search.

I don't think in terms of gists, but that's where some of these might
belong. If I was still blogging, much of this would be in blog posts.
I stopped blogging because the available infrastructure is all about
getting clicks, generating revenue, engagement, influencing, and
other such things.

I blogged to write. Being read is nice, but the writing is essential
to being.

A repository works for me.

Regardless, there's nothing important to anyone else here. Likely
nothing too interesting either. I expect some of these things are
'bad ideas'.

Use at your own risk. Some of the archived files may come with
copyright and/or license. I feel this sort of effort falls under
fair use. Those original rights and restrictions carry through
for those specific files. Everything I do is all public domain as
far as I'm concerned, but you can use any of my code or notes
as public domain under the UNLICENSE or under the terms of the MIT

So let it be written,
So let it be done.

                               ========
                               Contents
                               ========

In alphabetic order, here are the file names and short description.

LICENSE                -- The usual.

README.txt             -- This document.

Language_Configuration -- Subdirectory with language specific tool
                          configurations for Neovim, LSPs, Linters,
			  and Formatters.

booking-it.txt         -- I like old text books. Here's how and why I pick
                          and use them, with notes on one particular text
                          as context.
                      
brutalist.txt          -- The Brutalist Manifesto, an appeal for simplicity
                          and minimalism.

cmake.txt              -- A quick reference of what works for me with CMake
                          since it is needed to really use clangd.

csick.txt              -- A cross between a screed and a rant about
                          languages and what works (or doesn't) for me a
                          while back. Nothing is forever.

fortran90.org          -- My notes as I approached Modern Fortran. Out of
                          date and wrong pretty much from the get go, but
                          there are some bits in there worth keeping. Not
                          many, but a few. But the texts. They are cheap
                          and of high quality. Check in at the Fortran
                          Language Discourse.

fpc-command-line       -- A cheat sheet.

indianhill.txt         -- Revision 6.0 of the an early influential best
                          practices document for C.

retroreading.txt       -- Why and how I approach learning what I already
                          partially know. Some overlap here with the
                          booking-it.txt file.

schemes.scm            -- My notes on working with Scheme as I go through
                          several books on Lisp/Scheme programming. It's a
                          different way of seeing things.
