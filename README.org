* Troyisms -- There's the right way, the wrong way, and the Troy Way

Notes, tricks, code snippets, and things others might wish I didn't do.

I don't think in terms of gists, but that's where some of these might belong. A repository works for me.

Nothing too interesting here, and probably some bad ideas. It's all available under the UNLICENSE.
